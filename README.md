# LiveDimensions VRChat Prefabs
 A collection of all the prefabs I've made, they are all free to download and edit.
## Installation
All prefabs require you to have the latest [VRCSDK](https://vrchat.com/home/download) and [UdonSharp](https://github.com/MerlinVR/UdonSharp/releases/latest). After this, you can simply drag and drop one of the .unitypackages from releases into your Unity project.

## Usage
Most of the prefabs are drag and drop, which means you don't have to configure anything. But some scripts are for you to add as an UdonBehaviour and tweak settings to your liking, if you don't understand a script you can look at the prefab.
